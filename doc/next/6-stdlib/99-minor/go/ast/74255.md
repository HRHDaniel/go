Supports error propogation using the `^` operator just before a define or assignment operator (`=` or `:=`).
```go
^ = f()
i, ^ := g()
```
is the equivalent of
```go
var err error
err = f()
if err != nil {
    return err
}
i, err := g()
if err != nil {
    return err
}
```
`^` does not count as a new variable in the context of a `:=` operator. It must be the last variable in the list, and can only be used within a function whose return type is a tuple of the form `(..., error)`. Other return parameters are returned with their zero values.
